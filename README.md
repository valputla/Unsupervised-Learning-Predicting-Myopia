## General Information
This project uses PCA and TSNE for feature reduction before finding the best K to use with KMeans unsupervised machine learning model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TSNE
- PCA
- KMeans
-Scikit-learn

 ## Featured Notebooks and Files

* Resources - myopia csv file
* Myopia Unsupervised Learning - jupyter notebook  


 ## Conclusions

The best k is 3 to cluster the groups into thirds.
